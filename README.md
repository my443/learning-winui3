# App4 - Learning WinUI3

The purpose of this work is to learn more about WinUI3 and create a desktop application which lets me enter and display data. 

I won't be able to reference all of the sources that I draw from as this is a learning project. 
I will give credit where due if I am able to. 


* [Gridview XAML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.gridview?view=windows-app-sdk-1.4)
* [Dialog Box Help](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/2504)

**Don't forget to use the WinUI3 Gallery -- It is amazingly helpful!!**
